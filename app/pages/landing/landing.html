    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Mount Sinai KMC-IDG collects, processes, and maintains attributes about the druggable targets for all proposed families: protein kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, nuclear receptors and ion channels. Our emphasis is to focus on those genes/proteins that are under-studied and collect unbiased genome-wide profiling genomic datasets. In addition, the Mount Sinai's KMC-IDG collects, processes and maintain data tables and attributes for all other genes/proteins, drugs/small-molecules and other perturbagens, pheontypes/diseases/side-effects, and clinical as well as genomics datasets from cohorts of patients. This enables us to identify links between and across genes/proteins networks, drugs/small-molecules and other perturbagens networks, pheontypes/diseases/side-effects networks, and clusters of individual patients with similar profiles. For this, we develop and apply clustering and classification algorithms as well as workflows to make predictions about the potential applicability of targeting the under-studied proteins for various translational applications in personalized medicine.
